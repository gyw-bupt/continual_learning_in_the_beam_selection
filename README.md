# Continual-Learning-In-Beam-Selection


## Preparation
This repository was tested with python 3.6, pytorch 1.7.1 and cudatoolkit 10.1.

## Dataset
The raw dataset is Raymobtime. After partitioning and dimension processing, the resulting dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uXmD4Ygh2FqFAOVpM_T3rrJinL4NiLEh?usp=sharing.

## Run
Simply run `learn.py`, and modify the parameters in `get_args` to change the experimental settings.

## Thanks
The implementation of the code is based on open-source projects: https://github.com/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark
Thanks to the authors for their contributions.
